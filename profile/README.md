# Leipzig Institute for Meteorology - Atmospheric Radiation group

Welcome to our GitHub page! 

We are the Atmospheric Radiation working group of the Leipzig Institute for Meteorology and do research on the interaction of radiation with clouds and their influence on the radiative budget of the atmosphere.

We do lots of polar research at the moment using aircraft measurements in the Arctic to understand this diverse environment better.
You can take a look at our [current projects](https://www.physgeo.uni-leipzig.de/en/institute-for-meteorology/research/workinggroupatmosphericradiation/research/researchprojects#c405077).

On this site you will find repositories connected to our publications and a Python package that we use to share Python code with each other. Feel free to look around and fork a repository if it catches your interest.
